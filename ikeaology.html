<p class="text"> The autumn 2021 collection will be oriented towards cosiness, comfort and sleep. It will
				 fit into the Popular Modern style with some things bordering on Popuar Traditional. </p>
<p class="text"> October 2021 will see a IKEA gaming collection released, don't remember who was collaborating. </p>
<p class="text"> IKEA LV bought too much dark blue and pink paint, now in an effort to use it all they have made the
				autumn 2021 color profile for sleep dark blue and pink. Also featuring many RGB bulbs set to pink. </p>
<p class="text"> One EKET (I think) furniture line was released in collaboration with Off-White a long time ago.</p>
<p class="text"> A new line of furniture will be released in September or October 2021 in collaboration with some
				 designer I can't remember. Its key features will be that it is very pink and very weirdly designed.
				 Something modernist bordering on abstract. </p>
<p class="text"> IKEA groups <b>all</b> their products into four different design styles: </p>
				<ul>
				 <li class="text"> Popular Traditional: mellow and ornate (relatively), something you would see at your grandparents'. </li>
				 <li class="text"> Scandinavian Traditional: mellow and with geometric patterns and ornaments, something not out of place at a fishing village </li>
				 <li class="text"> Popular Modern: pastel colours (if any), few patterns, matte textures, something very fashionable at the moment. </li>
				 <li class="text"> Scandinavian Modern: bright colours, heavy use of patterns, minimalist design, something that is modern, but fun and colourful. </li>
				</ul>
