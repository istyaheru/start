<p class="text"> The autumn 2021 collection will be oriented towards cosiness, comfort and sleep. It will
				 fit into the Popular Modern style with some things bordering on Popuar Traditional. </p>
<p class="text"> October 2021 will see a IKEA gaming collection released, don't remember who was collaborating. </p>
<p class="text"> IKEA LV will lean more into fresh bread production instead of reheating. To do this, they will expand their bakery thing. </p>
<p class="text"> IKEA LV bought too much dark blue and pink paint, now in an effort to use it all they have made the
				autumn 2021 color profile for sleep dark blue and pink. Also featuring many RGB bulbs set to pink. </p>
<p class="text"> One EKET (I think) furniture line was released in collaboration with Off-White a long time ago.</p>
<p class="text"> A new line of furniture will be released in September or October 2021 in collaboration with some
				 designer I can't remember. Its key features will be that it is very pink and very weirdly designed.
				 Something modernist bordering on abstract. </p>
<b class="text"> It has been released and is gaudy as anything. I really don't think it should be called KARISMATISK. </b>
<p class="text"> IKEA divides the display hall decorations into four groups: </p>
				<ul>
				 <li class="text"> Sets: imitation apartments with full decor, often inspired by actual apartment layouts. </li>
					<ul>
					 <li class="text"> The first five sets when you walk onto the exhibition hall are each representative
									 of one IKEA design style (see below) and one that is relevant to the locale and clientelle 
									 of the store. They have shapes that are inspired by popular apartment layouts in the area. </li>
					</ul>
				 <li class="text"> Vignettes: small, noticeable areas that focus on one item in particular.
					<ul>
					 <li class="text"> They are sometimes placed in the way of foot traffic, sometimes in line with the shelves. 
									If a vignette is painted red, that signifies that the item displayed in it has the lowest price 
									out of any such item in the whole country. For example, if a vignette painted red displays a 
									SIBBEN/LOBERGET chair, that means that it is the lowest priced swivel chair in the country. </li>
					</ul>
				 <li class="text"> Forgot the name, but they are small sets focusing on one specific room, they have no walls. </li>
				 <li class="text"> Forgot the fourth. </li>
				</ul>
<p class="text"> IKEA groups <b>all</b> their products into four different design styles: </p>
				<ul>
				 <li class="text"> Popular Traditional: mellow and ornate (relatively), something you would see at your grandparents'. </li>
				 <li class="text"> Scandinavian Traditional: mellow and with geometric patterns and ornaments, something not out of place at a fishing village </li>
				 <li class="text"> Popular Modern: pastel colours (if any), few patterns, matte textures, something very fashionable at the moment. </li>
				 <li class="text"> Scandinavian Modern: bright colours, heavy use of patterns, minimalist design, something that is modern, but fun and colourful. </li>
				</ul>
<p class="text"> Something like a GULLKLOCKA pillowcase fits into Scandinavian Modern, while a cinnamon bun
				 (I shitteth thee not, this rule extends to food) fits into Popular Traditional.
