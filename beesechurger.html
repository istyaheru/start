	<td> <p class="maintext">	Recently, I was at a Lidl. This by itself is already fairly bad news, but I was also 
	slightly hungry. Not hungry enough to go to a McDonkeys, but I could use something. Lidl (the scheming bastards) 
	had catered to my want and some packages with the mysterious text "Beef Cheese" in <b>big, bold</b> letters emblazoned 
	on it split with patches of seeping oil. I took one (much to my later regret) and paid for it. By the time I was out 
	of the store, the package was already feeling a bit colder and quite a lot harder than it had originally. Opening 
	it, I was greeted by a slouched-over bun with just the slightest glimpse of a tiny, unusually smooth patty in between. 
	</p>
	<p class="maintext">	The microscopic size of the bun was only further attested to by the first bite which was 
	entirely bun and cheese. Not a bad bun, by the way, which was a good thing since the bun was the predominant source of any flavor 
	for a while. The cheese was not horrid, it's texture was like that of American cheese - waxy (except for the bits stuck out of the bun - those were like PVC), it's flavor was, however, 
	surprisingly present and acceptable. The patty was paper thin and entirely devoid of any taste. In an outstanding feat of culinary engineering, 
	it was also devoid of any texture. I really stretch myself to explain how they achieved this. Reaching the middle of the 
	burger product, I was suddenly thrust into goddamn <i>Sauce Station</i>. The burger had gone from bland to sour 
	and I was reminded of <a class="maintext" href="https://old.reddit.com/r/copypasta/comments/e3289b/burrito_rant/">that Reddit post</a> ranting and raving about the proper construction of a burritto. 
	A change, but I'm not sure if it was a welcome one. In the middle, the soulless machine that hath made this had 
	deposited a ketchup and a relish. Due to the long shelf life of this foodstuff, the flavors had gotten to know 
	each other a bit too well. By this point they were probably long married and growing old whilst watching their 
	child Vinegar copulate with their next-door-neighbor Patty. Thusly, the patty had now lost any texture and the 
	middle of the burger product was mush. Sour mush at that! After exiting Flavortown, the burger product returned 
	to its previous boring, bland self.
	</p>
	<p class="maintext">	In conclusion, the Lidl "Beef Cheese" was a thoroughly unenjoyable product and I wouldn't 
	reccomend anyone torture themselves with it. It came out like it came in - as a soulless mush.
