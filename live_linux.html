	<td> <p class="maintext">	A good workaround to pesky admin-installed restrictions on your workstation	at school is a live USB stick with Linux on it! 
							By having such an item you would be bypassing the admin restrictions by just not booting into Windows altogether! </p>
		 <ul class="maintext">	<b> Prerequisites and limitations of this approach (please read) </b> </ul>
			<li class="maintext"> You must be able to access the boot menu of the PC in question, </li>
			<li class="maintext"> The USB stick you use must be larger than 8GB if you want to install any meaningful programs onto it, </li>
			<li class="maintext"> It may preferably be USB 3.0 or faster. If it isn't, your Linux experience will be very slow, </li>
			<li class="maintext"> This tutorial uses MX Linux as the OS for installation onto the USB stick. This is because it is very easy to enable 
			persistence on it. You may use another distro, but then this tutorial might not work for you. </li>
		 </ul>
		 <br>
		 <b class="maintext"> How to actually do it </b>
		 <p class="maintext"> First, get your image of <a class="maintext" href="https://mxlinux.org/download-links/"> MX Linux</a>. You can get it on their site very easily. I recommend the XFCE edition since it's much lighter on system resources than 
							the KDE Plasma edition, which improves quality of life a lot on a live USB. </p>
		 <p class="maintext"> Second, burn it to your USB stick of choice. An easy tool to do it from Windows is <a class="maintext" href="https://rufus.ie/en/">Rufus</a>. Don't mess 
							with the block sizes and formatting, leave that as is. You may make a persistent partition, it's just not necessary. </p>
		 <p class="maintext"> Thirdly, restart your PC and boot into your freshly burnt MX Linux. This is done by acessing either the boot menu or the BIOS 
							from the startup screen. Simply mash either F12 or Del or F9 or F1 or F2 or F10 (depending on the maker of your motherboard) and select 
							your USB stick as the boot device. </p>
		 <p class="maintext"> Fourthly, select the Customize Boot option of the boot screen. This will throw you into a command prompt with multiple options 
							to select. The ones that concern us are prompts 4 and 5. 4 concerns whether we want to enable persistence and we do, so select dostore option. 
							5 concerns what we want persistence on, the root folder, the home folder or both. We want both, so select persist_all. Select whatever is appropriate 
							for the other prompts. Afterwards it will ask you to create a rootfs, a homefs and a swap partition. Create these according to the size of your USB 
							stick, though, for some reason, neither homefs nor rootfs can be made larger than 4GB, at least for me. Create a rootfs and a homefs, the swap partition 
							is not necessary, especially for systems with more than 4GB of RAM. </p>
		 <p class="maintext"> Fifthly, log into your demo profile with login: demo and password: whatever you set it to. Open up the terminal and type </p>
		 <p class="maintext">	sudo mx-packageinstaller </p>
		 <p class="maintext"> Type in your password. Once MX Package Installer opens, search for Steam in it and install it. Accept the EULA and once it installs open terminal and type
		 <p class="maintext">	su -c steam </p>
		 <p class="maintext"> This should open Steam and allow you to log in. Once you've done that install any game(s) you have space for. </p>
		 <p class="maintext"> To run Steam again, run it through the terminal with su -c steam from now on and run games through Steam. </p>
